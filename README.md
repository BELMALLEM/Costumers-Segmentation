### Import libraries
Lets first import the required libraries.
Also run <b> %matplotlib inline </b> since we will be plotting in this section.


```python
import random 
import numpy as np 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans 
from sklearn.datasets.samples_generator import make_blobs 
%matplotlib inline
```

<h1 id="random_generated_dataset">k-Means on a randomly generated dataset</h1>
Lets create our own dataset for this lab!


First we need to set up a random seed. Use <b>numpy's random.seed()</b> function, where the seed will be set to <b>0</b>


```python
np.random.seed(0)
```

Next we will be making <i> random clusters </i> of points by using the <b> make_blobs </b> class. The <b> make_blobs </b> class can take in many inputs, but we will be using these specific ones. <br> <br>
<b> <u> Input </u> </b>
<ul>
    <li> <b>n_samples</b>: The total number of points equally divided among clusters. </li>
    <ul> <li> Value will be: 5000 </li> </ul>
    <li> <b>centers</b>: The number of centers to generate, or the fixed center locations. </li>
    <ul> <li> Value will be: [[4, 4], [-2, -1], [2, -3],[1,1]] </li> </ul>
    <li> <b>cluster_std</b>: The standard deviation of the clusters. </li>
    <ul> <li> Value will be: 0.9 </li> </ul>
</ul>
<br>
<b> <u> Output </u> </b>
<ul>
    <li> <b>X</b>: Array of shape [n_samples, n_features]. (Feature Matrix)</li>
    <ul> <li> The generated samples. </li> </ul> 
    <li> <b>y</b>: Array of shape [n_samples]. (Response Vector)</li>
    <ul> <li> The integer labels for cluster membership of each sample. </li> </ul>
</ul>



```python
X, y = make_blobs(n_samples=5000, centers=[[4,4], [-2, -1], [2, -3], [1, 1]], cluster_std=0.9)
```


```python
y
```

Display the scatter plot of the randomly generated data.


```python
plt.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], marker='2')
```

<h2 id="setting_up_K_means">Setting up K-Means</h2>
Now that we have our random data, let's set up our K-Means Clustering.


```python
k_means = KMeans(init = "k-means++", n_clusters = 4, n_init = 12)
```

Now let's fit the KMeans model with the feature matrix we created above, <b> X </b>


```python
k_means.fit(X)
```

Now let's grab the labels for each point in the model using KMeans' <b> .labels\_ </b> attribute and save it as <b> k_means_labels </b> 


```python
k_means_labels = k_means.labels_
k_means_labels
```

We will also get the coordinates of the cluster centers using KMeans' <b> .cluster&#95;centers&#95; </b> and save it as <b> k_means_cluster_centers </b>


```python
k_means_cluster_centers = k_means.cluster_centers_
k_means_cluster_centers
```

<h2 id="creating_visual_plot">Creating the Visual Plot</h2>
So now that we have the random data generated and the KMeans model initialized, let's plot them and see what it looks like!

Please read through the code and comments to understand how we ploted the model.


```python
# Initialize the plot with the specified dimensions.
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(6, 4))

# Colors uses a color map, which will produce an array of colors based on
# the number of labels there are. We use set(k_means_labels) to get the
# unique labels.
colors = plt.cm.Spectral(np.linspace(0, 1, len(set(k_means_labels))))

# Create a plot
ax = fig.add_subplot(1, 1, 1)

# For loop that plots the data points and centroids.
# k will range from 0-3, which will match the possible clusters that each
# data point is in.
for k, col in zip(range(len([[4,4], [-2, -1], [2, -3], [1, 1]])), colors):

    # Create a list of all data points, where the data poitns that are 
    # in the cluster (ex. cluster 0) are labeled as true, else they are
    # labeled as false.
    my_members = (k_means_labels == k)
    
    # Define the centroid, or cluster center.
    cluster_center = k_means_cluster_centers[k]
    
    # Plots the datapoints with color col.
    ax.plot(X[my_members, 0], X[my_members, 1], 'w', markerfacecolor=col, marker='.')
    
    # Plots the centroids with specified color, but with a darker outline
    ax.plot(cluster_center[0], cluster_center[1], 'o', markerfacecolor=col,  markeredgecolor='k', markersize=6)

# Title of the plot
ax.set_title('KMeans')

# Remove x-axis ticks
ax.set_xticks(())

# Remove y-axis ticks
ax.set_yticks(())

# Show the plot
plt.show()

```

## Practice
We'll try to cluster the above dataset into 3 clusters.


```python
k_means = KMeans(init="k-means++", n_clusters=3, n_init=15)
k_means.fit(X)
kmeans_labels = k_means.labels_
kmeans_cluster_centers = k_means.cluster_centers_
```


```python
# Initialize the plot with the specified dimensions.
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(6, 4))

# Colors uses a color map, which will produce an array of colors based on
# the number of labels there are. We use set(k_means_labels) to get the
# unique labels.
colors = plt.cm.Spectral(np.linspace(0, 1, len(set(kmeans_labels))))

# Create a plot
ax = fig.add_subplot(1, 1, 1)

# For loop that plots the data points and centroids.
# k will range from 0-3, which will match the possible clusters that each
# data point is in.
for k, col in zip(range(len([[4,4], [-2, -1], [2, -3], [1, 1]])), colors):

    # Create a list of all data points, where the data poitns that are 
    # in the cluster (ex. cluster 0) are labeled as true, else they are
    # labeled as false.
    my_members = (kmeans_labels == k)
    
    # Define the centroid, or cluster center.
    cluster_center = kmeans_cluster_centers[k]
    
    # Plots the datapoints with color col.
    ax.plot(X[my_members, 0], X[my_members, 1], 'w', markerfacecolor=col, marker='.')
    
    # Plots the centroids with specified color, but with a darker outline
    ax.plot(cluster_center[0], cluster_center[1], 'o', markerfacecolor=col,  markeredgecolor='k', markersize=6)

# Title of the plot
ax.set_title('KMeans')

# Remove x-axis ticks
ax.set_xticks(())

# Remove y-axis ticks
ax.set_yticks(())

# Show the plot
plt.show()
```

k_means3 = KMeans(init = "k-means++", n_clusters = 3, n_init = 12)
k_means3.fit(X)
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(6, 4))
colors = plt.cm.Spectral(np.linspace(0, 1, len(set(k_means3.labels_))))
ax = fig.add_subplot(1, 1, 1)
for k, col in zip(range(len(k_means3.cluster_centers_)), colors):
    my_members = (k_means3.labels_ == k)
    cluster_center = k_means3.cluster_centers_[k]
    ax.plot(X[my_members, 0], X[my_members, 1], 'w', markerfacecolor=col, marker='.')

<h1 id="customer_segmentation_K_means">Customer Segmentation with K-Means</h1>
Imagine that you have a customer dataset, and you need to apply customer segmentation on this historical data.
Customer segmentationÂ is the practice of partitioning a customer base into groups of individuals that have similar characteristics. It is a significant strategy as a business can target these specific groups of customers and effectively allocate marketing resources. For example, one group might contain customers who are high-profit and low-risk, that is, more likely to purchase products, or subscribe for a service. A business task is to retaining those customers. Another group might include customers from non-profit organizations. And so on.

Lets download the dataset. To download the data, we will use **`!wget`** .


```python
!wget -O Cust_Segmentation.csv https://s3-api.us-geo.objectstorage.softlayer.net/cf-courses-data/CognitiveClass/ML0101ENv3/labs/Cust_Segmentation.csv
```

### Load Data From CSV File  
Before you can work with the data, you must use the URL to get the Cust_Segmentation.csv.


```python
import pandas as pd
cust_df = pd.read_csv("Cust_Segmentation.csv")
cust_df.head()
```

<h2 id="pre_processing">Pre-processing</h2

As you can see, __Address__ in this dataset is a categorical variable. k-means algorithm isn't directly applicable to categorical variables because Euclidean distance function isn't really meaningful for discrete variables. So, lets drop this feature and run clustering.


```python
df = cust_df.drop('Address', axis=1)
df.head()
```

#### Normalizing over the standard deviation
Now let's normalize the dataset. But why do we need normalization in the first place? Normalization is a statistical method that helps mathematical-based algorithms to interpret features with different magnitudes and distributions equally. We use __StandardScaler()__ to normalize our dataset.


```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
X = df.values[:,1:]
X = np.nan_to_num(X)
Clus_dataSet = StandardScaler().fit_transform(X)
Clus_dataSet
```

<h2 id="modeling">Modeling</h2>

In our example (if we didn't have access to the k-means algorithm), it would be the same as guessing that each customer group would have certain age, income, education, etc, with multiple tests and experiments. However, using the K-means clustering we can do all this process much easier.

Lets apply k-means on our dataset, and take look at cluster labels.


```python
clusterNum = 3
k_means = KMeans(init = "k-means++", n_clusters = clusterNum, n_init = 12)
k_means.fit(X)
labels = k_means.labels_
print(labels)
```

<h2 id="insights">Insights</h2>
We assign the labels to each row in dataframe.


```python
df["Clus_km"] = labels
df.head(5)
```

We can easily check the centroid values by averaging the features in each cluster.


```python
df.groupby('Clus_km').mean()
```

Now, lets look at the distribution of customers based on their age and income:


```python
area = np.pi * ( X[:, 1])**2  
plt.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 3], s=area, c=labels.astype(np.float), alpha=0.5)
plt.xlabel('Age', fontsize=18)
plt.ylabel('Income', fontsize=16)

plt.show()

```


```python
from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D 
fig = plt.figure(1, figsize=(8, 6))
plt.clf()
ax = Axes3D(fig, rect=[0, 0, .95, 1], elev=48, azim=134)

plt.cla()
ax.set_xlabel('Education')
ax.set_ylabel('Age')
ax.set_zlabel('Income')

ax.scatter(X[:, 1], X[:, 0], X[:, 3], c= labels.astype(np.float))

```

k-means will partition your customers into mutually exclusive groups, for example, into 3 clusters. The customers in each cluster are similar to each other demographically.
Now we can create a profile for each group, considering the common characteristics of each cluster. 
For example, the 3 clusters can be:

- AFFLUENT, EDUCATED AND OLD AGED
- MIDDLE AGED AND MIDDLE INCOME
- YOUNG AND LOW INCOME
